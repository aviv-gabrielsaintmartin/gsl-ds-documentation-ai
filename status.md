# Status

_The only page you need. Everything else in this repo is reference material for
agents — looked up, never read through._

## What we're building

A written description of the GSL Design System complete enough that an AI agent
can read it and design a screen in Figma using the right components and the
right colours, with nobody correcting it.

**Deadline: end of September 2026.** Only "did it use the right things" counts.
"Is it a good design" comes later, on purpose.

---

## Where we are

Designing a screen is seven steps. **One of them is fully written.**

| The step | Written? |
| --- | --- |
| Define the content — from the user need | ❌ **Nothing.** No rule, no doc, no task |
| Define the components to use, and which variant | ✅ Written, and tested cold three times |
| Define what needs to be built | 🟡 The rule says "declare it" and never says where the declaration goes |
| Choose the tokens — colour, text style, spacing | 🟡 **Seven of twelve kinds** have a ruleset. Five don't |
| Put them on the screen | 🟡 An agent can place a component, but can't put words in one |
| Place them per the design guidance | ❌ Written, but never checked against a real screen |
| Check the content | ❌ **Nothing**, and the scorecard can't see copy or tone either |

Plus a scoring sheet, now laid out as the same seven steps. Each step asks a
short list of yes-or-no questions; four steps have questions, three have none and
say so. Never yet used on a real run.

---

## The next task

**Done: the scoring sheet is rebuilt around the seven steps, and the *Parts*
column is gone with the check that read it.** Every question is yes-or-no,
phrased so `no` is the good answer. The sheet found real drift — three of the six
token deny-lists had been written and wired into no check. The column went
because it printed an assembly recipe for the one thing the rules forbid, in the
file a generating agent reads, for a reader that no longer existed.

**Next: say where a declaration physically lives.** Half a day. The rules end
every invention with "declare it" and never say **where** that goes.

**Then: take the audit links out of the five token rulesets.** Half an hour. The
same forbidden door closed in the components ruleset, six times over.

Your generating skill — screen *and* report — is yours, and deliberately later;
it needed this format settled first. One catch: `design` is already a built-in
skill name, so pick another.

How tasks are sorted, and why, is at the top of
[the backlog](project/backlog.md).

## The question I'd like answered first

> **Still open: the energy filter slider ships on web and was never added to the
> Figma libraries.** An agent asked to build one has working web code to copy
> and no Figma component to place. Get it added, or tell agents to compose it?

Around two dozen questions are waiting, all in
[project/backlog.md](project/backlog.md). I'll bring them one at a time.

## How we work

```
   pick the next task
          │
          ▼
   I explain it: what, why, how long  ──►  you approve
          │
          ▼
   I do it
          │
          ▼
   we check it worked
          │
     ┌────┴────┐
    yes        no
     │          │
     ▼          ▼
   log it    sub-task to fix it ──┐
     │                            │
     └────►  next task  ◄─────────┘
```

Two commands drive it:

| Type this | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **`/task-next`** | I propose one task — what, why, how long, whether it needs you. **I wait for your go.** Then I do it and report in three lines |
| **`/task-check`** | I verify it actually worked and tell you pass or fail. Passed → logged, saved, next task named. Failed → a sub-task to fix it becomes next |

**One task, one chat.** Start each task in a new conversation with `/task-next`.
You never have to watch anything — `/task-check` finishing is the signal. Stay
put within a task, and for conversations like this one.

**Nothing is written without your approval.** Reading and searching are free.
The handful of exceptions — this page, the backlog, and adding a file's name to
a list of files — are written down in one place, `CLAUDE.md`.

### How the work gets saved

**One task = one commit.** No branches, no pull requests — you work alone, and
the loop already does what a branch was doing.

| When | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| The check **passes** | I commit and push straight away. That's your backup — if the laptop dies, the work exists |
| The check **fails** | Nothing is committed, and I'll tell you the work isn't saved yet |

Committing and pushing only ever **add** — they can't lose anything, which is
why they don't need your approval. The operations that could lose something —
undoing, deleting, rewriting history — **always ask you first, every time.**

**Anything that surfaces mid-task gets written into the backlog, not into the
conversation** — as a task I can do, a question only you can answer, or a note.
That's the rule that stops findings from disappearing into chat.

## Two files, and that's all

| File | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| **`status.md`** — this page | Where we are, what's next. Never longer than one screen |
| [**`project/backlog.md`**](project/backlog.md) | Everything else — every task, every open question, every finding. Open it whenever you want the whole picture |
